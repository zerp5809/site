     <h1>About</h1>
                        <p> Hello, My name is Shane Yang. I have recently graduated from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona with a Bachelor’s of Science in Business Administration with an emphasis in Computer Information Systems.</p>
                        <p>In my studies at Cal Poly, I covered many subjects in both technology and business. In my technical course work I have taken many classes relating to application development and network connectivity. I have experience with building and configuring machines to be used as ESXI hosts, and experience with configuring networks. Aside from my technical coursework, I participated in several business courses including Accounting, Finance, Operations Management, and Marketing. This mixture of business and technology classes allows me to combine technical and non-technical realms in the workplace.</p>
                        <p>From a young age I have been interested in all things technology. Over the years I have spent many countless hours learning and understanding the inner workings of different machines. I enjoy working with new technologies and I am quick to learn them. I am hard working and find myself solving problems as soon as possible. </p>
